## WTF? Fun!

These are some fun alternative ways of showing your IP address.

* [Emoji IP](/fun/emoji) – your IP address as emoji numbers.
* [Speak my IP](/fun/speak) – read out your IP address.
* [Shell](/sh) – command line; type `ip` to see your IP address (see also
  [Wordle over DNS](https://dgl.cx/2022/02/wordle-over-dns)).
* [Spin](/fun/spin) - spinning IP address (⚠️  fast moving graphics)
